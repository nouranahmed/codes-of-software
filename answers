###
question 1)
class is a data structure that has data member and function member whci have many access ways (private or public)
private members cant be accessed by user while public members can be accessed by user, instance of this data is called object 
we use class to organize any large system

###
questin 2)
data hiding in class: in private section we make data hidings as any data will be written cant be accessed from outside class except by
methods of class
abstraction of class: class that cant be instatntiate and its implemented as a class that have one or more abstract function so
its a class which define an implelmentation and inherited by concrete classes (classes can be instantiated)
encapsulation of class:packing of data and function in single component so it bulid a walll to protect code from corruption as it allows 
selective hiding of properties so it construct facilities that bund data with methods or other functions operatind on data

###
question 3)
object is an instance of class for example class is blueprint while object is house which bulit from blueprint we can have many
houses with same floor plan but each have its own instance

###
question 5)
function member is a public one which can be accessed by user while data member is a private one which cant be accessed by user except
by class methods

###
question 6)
constructor: is a special member function of a class that is excuted whenever we create new object of class and it have same name of class and doesnt have any return type at all 
destructor: special member function thats excuted whenevr an object of class goes out of scope or the delete expression is applied 
and it have same name of class with ~ and also no return nor taking parameters 

###
question 7)
done as we made default constructor

###
question 8)default constructor is a constructor which all parameters are default values as it can be called without providing any arguments
advantage: it helps us to initalize any object 

###
question 10)
this : pointer refering to object calling current function,, this -> fname="nouran" 
*this : is the object calling current function ,, this.fname="nouran"
